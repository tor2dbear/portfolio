![Header example](things08.webp)

Hugo uses the excellent [go][] [html/template][gohtmltemplate] library for
its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very
small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of
logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other
template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of
similarities in go templates.
