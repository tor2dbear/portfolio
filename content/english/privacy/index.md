# Privacy

In line with GDPR and to be transparent, this page explains what data I collect on tor-bjorn.com, how it is used, and how I keep it safe.

## What data I collect
- Newsletter sign‑ups: email address submitted via the form in the footer.
- Contact form: name, email address, subject, and message.

This site does not use first‑party analytics or tracking cookies. However, some third‑party services may set cookies, such as Google reCAPTCHA (used on the contact form).

I also use Google Search Console to understand how visitors find the site via Google Search. This does not give me access to personal data about you.

## What I do with the data
- Newsletter data is stored in Mailchimp and used only to send newsletters to people who have explicitly subscribed.
- Contact form data is sent via Make.com to my email so I can respond to your message.

I do not sell personal information or share it with third‑party data brokers.

## How I keep your data safe
I use strong, unique passwords and two‑factor authentication for service accounts. Access is limited to services needed to operate the site.

Please note that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. I take reasonable steps to protect your data, but I cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Questions or deletion requests
If you have any concerns or want your data deleted, email me at hi@tor-bjorn.com.
