## Product Owner with Design DNA

I bring a unique combination rarely found in one person: **strategic product ownership backed by deep design expertise**. After 9 years at Lokalguiden, I've evolved from Art Director to Product Owner while maintaining my design capabilities.

### Why This Combination Matters

**I understand both what to build AND how it should work.**

- As a **Product Owner**, I prioritize backlogs, write user stories, and drive data-driven decisions
- As a **Designer**, I ensure every feature is not just functional, but beautifully crafted
- This dual perspective means faster decisions, better collaboration, and products that succeed on both fronts
