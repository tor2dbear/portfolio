### Challenge

Lokalguiden's admin interface had evolved organically over years, resulting in inconsistent UI patterns, confusing navigation, and inefficient workflows. Internal teams struggled with daily tasks, leading to decreased productivity and increased training time for new staff.

**Key Problems:**
- Inconsistent interface patterns and navigation
- Poor information architecture making features hard to find
- Outdated visual design reducing usability
- No design system leading to fragmented experience

### Approach

**Research & Discovery**
- Conducted user interviews with internal staff across departments
- Mapped common workflows and pain points
- Audited existing interface for usability issues
- Analyzed task completion times and error rates

**Information Architecture**
- Restructured navigation based on user mental models
- Grouped related functions logically
- Created clear hierarchy for primary and secondary tasks
- Simplified user flows for frequent operations

**UI/UX Design**
- Developed consistent design patterns and components
- Created visual design language for admin context
- Improved readability and visual hierarchy
- Designed for efficiency and reduced cognitive load

### Solution

**Restructured Information Architecture**
- Logical grouping of admin functions
- Streamlined navigation reducing clicks to common tasks
- Clear dashboard showing key metrics and recent activity

**Consistent UI System**
- Reusable components for tables, forms, and actions
- Cohesive color coding and iconography
- Improved typography and spacing for readability
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

**Enhanced Workflows**
- Simplified multi-step processes
- Better error handling and validation
- Quick actions for common tasks
- Improved search and filtering capabilities

### Impact

- **Reduced task completion time** for frequent operations
- **Decreased training time** for new staff members
- **Improved staff satisfaction** with daily tools
- **Foundation for design system** used across all Lokalguiden products
- **Fewer user errors** due to clearer interface patterns

### Role

Art Director / Product Designer – Led research, redesigned information architecture, created UI designs, and worked with developers to implement new interface.

### Transition to Product Owner

This project marked a pivotal shift in my role at Lokalguiden. While I started as Art Director focusing on visual design, this admin redesign required deep involvement in user research, workflow optimization, and working closely with development teams – setting the foundation for my evolution into a Product Owner role.
