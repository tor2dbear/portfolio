### Challenge

- Developed comprehensive visual guidelines for consistent application
- Created flexible design system that works across print and digital

**Implementation**
- Redesigned print magazine with new layout and typography
- Updated website design to reflect new brand identity
- Created templates for marketing materials and print products
- Established color palette, typography rules, and component library

### Solution

The new brand identity successfully bridges traditional print heritage with modern digital presence:

- **Modern logo** that's scalable and works in various contexts
- **Comprehensive brand guidelines** ensuring consistency across all touchpoints
- **Refreshed magazine design** with improved readability and visual hierarchy
- **Updated website** with cleaner interface and better user experience
- **Print materials** aligned with new visual identity

### Impact
