clientabout: Utblick is a student magazine under the umbrella of the Society of International Affairs in Gothenburg (Utrikespolitiska Föreningen), but we write for everyone, in and beyond Gothenburg, who are interested in international politics. The society is party politically and religiously unaffiliated and the main goal is to question and debate. We are however not afraid of taking a political stance in relation to human rights as has been declared by the UN declaration of human rights, as well as specifically the rights of women, LGBT, and BIPOC to be respected.
