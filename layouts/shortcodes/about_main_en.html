    Product Owner & Art Director based in Gothenburg. I bridge design and
    product strategy – combining UI/UX expertise with data-driven prioritization.
  </h3>

  <p class="about-main__text type-body">
    Hi! My name is Torbjörn Hedberg. I lead digital product development by owning
    the backlog, writing user stories, and running sprints – while maintaining
    design quality through my background in visual communication, UI/UX design,
    and brand development.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="about-main__text">
    My unique strength is understanding both what users need and what drives
    business value. I've evolved from Art Director to Product Owner, giving me
    the ability to not only design solutions, but also prioritize what should
    be built and why.
  </p>

  <h3 class="about-main__headline mt-32 mb-32 type-headline-3">
    I lead development teams through structured, agile processes while
    ensuring every release is both functional and beautifully designed.
  </h3>

  <p class="about-main__text">
    Working in 2-week sprints with developers and stakeholders, I translate
    business goals and user needs into concrete features. My day involves
    backlog management, sprint planning, user story writing, design system
    maintenance, and analyzing traffic and conversion metrics.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="about-main__text">
    Whether you need someone who can drive product strategy, lead agile teams,
    or create exceptional user experiences – I bring all three.
